Hello, just call me BEX for now but I looking to become a computer programer and hopefully some day an AI programer.
I have some knowlege in Python and I am still learning Pyhon to this day. I might have some projects and some big ones as well.
But mainly I just need some help in the programing world, I am sometimes busy so I wont always answer right away.

Just something to keep in mind, is that I am not the best reader so I am more visual and it can be hard for me to understand long codes.
I will update this whenever I can and have something new.
